== Description ==
This is a plugin developed for the newest feed from YCombinator News which has no RSS feed. It's very gentle and doesn't hit the server too often. Always be polite to others. Bit of a YCNews junkie, and annoyed I couldn't get a feed on ([my site](https://markbaartse.com "my site")) so built this.
